<h1>UNO: Ultra Spectrum</h1>
<p><em>A fork of the UNO: Full Spectrum variant</em></p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>UNO: Ultra Spectrum builds upon the Full Spectrum version by combining multiple UNO decks and adding powerful new cards and mechanics from several expansion packs. This creates a colorful and chaotic gameplay experience with more strategy and unpredictability.</p>

<h2>2. Required Decks and Cards</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Regular UNO (red, blue, green, yellow)</li>
  <li>UNO Flip Express (teal, pink)</li>
  <li>UNO Neo-Partisan (orange, purple)</li>
  <li>Susan G. Komen UNO (pink)</li>
  <li>Add-on packs: Reverse Pack, Swap Pack, Show No Mercy (+6 and +10 cards)</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Colors in Play</h2>
<p>The following colors are used in play:</p>
<div class="colors-list" style="justify-content:center;">
  <span class="color-chip red">Red</span>
  <span class="color-chip orange">Orange</span>
  <span class="color-chip yellow">Yellow</span>
  <span class="color-chip green">Green</span>
  <span class="color-chip teal">Teal</span>
  <span class="color-chip blue">Blue</span>
  <span class="color-chip purple">Purple</span>
  <span class="color-chip pink">Pink</span>
</div>

<h2>4. Basic UNO Rules Refresher</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Each player is dealt 7 cards.</li>
  <li>On your turn, play one card matching either the color or number of the discard pile’s top card.</li>
  <li>If you cannot play, draw one card from the draw pile.</li>
  <li>If the drawn card can be played, you may play it immediately; otherwise, your turn ends.</li>
  <li>Play proceeds clockwise unless reversed.</li>
  <li>Special cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, Wild Draw Four) act as in regular UNO.</li>
  <li>When you have one card left, say "UNO" before your next turn begins. If caught not saying it, draw two cards.</li>
  <li>The first player to play all their cards wins the round.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Special Cards from Add-On Packs</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reverse +2 (Reverse Pack):</strong> Reverses play order and forces the next player to draw two cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Swap Hands (Swap Pack):</strong> All players pass their entire hand to the next player in the current direction of play.</li>
  <li><strong>+6 Card (Show No Mercy):</strong> Forces the next player to draw six cards unless they can block or stack.</li>
  <li><strong>+10 Card (Show No Mercy):</strong> Forces the next player to draw ten cards unless they can block or stack.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Flip Express Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When a Flip card is played, players switch decks accordingly.</li>
  <li>Players may only play cards that match the color or number of the discard pile’s top card.</li>
  <li>Play continues until the next Flip card reverses the side again.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. New Custom Rules</h2>

<h3>Color Hue Direction</h3>
<p>You may play cards in either forward or backward hue order. The color sequence is:</p>
<div class="colors-list" style="justify-content:center;">
  <span class="color-chip red">Red</span>
  <span>→</span>
  <span class="color-chip orange">Orange</span>
  <span>→</span>
  <span class="color-chip yellow">Yellow</span>
  <span>→</span>
  <span class="color-chip green">Green</span>
  <span>→</span>
  <span class="color-chip teal">Teal</span>
  <span>→</span>
  <span class="color-chip blue">Blue</span>
  <span>→</span>
  <span class="color-chip purple">Purple</span>
  <span>→</span>
  <span class="color-chip pink">Pink</span>
  <span>→</span>
  <span>Red (repeats)</span>
</div>
<p>You may play a card matching either the next or previous color in this hue sequence instead of the same color.</p>

<h3>Stacking and Blocking</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Draw cards of the same type may be stacked, passing the cumulative draw penalty to the next player.</li>
  <li>A +6 or +10 card may be blocked by playing a Wild card or a Reverse +2 card, which reverses play direction and passes the penalty on.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Color Lockdown</h3>
<p>If the same color is played three turns in a row, that color becomes locked for one full round. No player may play that color until a Wild card is played.</p>

<h3>Spectrum Flush Bonus</h3>
<p>If a player manages to play at least one card of every color in the spectrum during a single round, all opponents must draw two cards.</p>

<h2>8. Winning the Game</h2>
<p>The game is played in rounds. The first player to reach 500 points wins. Points are scored based on cards remaining in opponents’ hands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Number cards: face value</li>
  <li>Draw Two, Reverse, Skip: 20 points each</li>
  <li>Wild and Wild Draw Four: 50 points each</li>
  <li>+6 and +10 cards: 50 points each</li>
</ul>
